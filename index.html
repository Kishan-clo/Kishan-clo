    <h1> Welcome to my Website! </h1>
    <p align=left>In this website I will be talking about different games and how they work. Also, I will be telling you about the aim of the game.
     </p>
    <h2> <u>Minecraft</u> </h2>
    <p>In Minecraft, you have to either, beat the <strong>ender dragon</strong>, or you can survive forever and get all achievements. Or you can go hardcore mode which if you die once, 
      you die forever.
 | Bullseye - Hit the bullseye of a Target block 
| Cover me in debris - Wear a full set of Netherite armor 
| Ooooh, shiny! - Distract a Piglin using gold
| Hot tourist destination - Visit all Nether biomes |
      <strong> These are some of the nether achievements. (exept the bullsye) </strong> There are many more achivements than these.
    </p>
      <h3> <u>Roblox</u> </h3>
    <p>In Roblox, you can play different games that people make and you can create your own games in <strong>Roblox Studios</strong>. You can also create your own character with
      Roblox' currency, <strong>Robux</strong>. Be careful though, because there a lot of scam games that say "free Robux" and you can never get free robux. You always have to 
      buy it with real money.
