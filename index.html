    <h1> Welcome to my Website! </h1>

     </p>
    <h2> <u>Minecraft</u> </h2>

    <caption><strong>This is an example of Netherite Armor</strong></caption>
    <p>In Minecraft, you have to either, beat the <strong>ender dragon</strong>, or you can survive forever and get all achievements. Or you can go hardcore mode which if you die once, 
      you die forever.
 | Bullseye - Hit the bullseye of a Target block 
| Cover me in debris - Wear a full set of Netherite armor 
| Ooooh, shiny! - Distract a Piglin using gold
| Hot tourist destination - Visit all Nether biomes |
      <strong> These are some of the nether achievements. (exept the bullsye) </strong> There are many more achivements than these.
    </p>
      <h3> <u>Roblox</u> </h3>

     <caption><strong>This is some games in Roblox  (you need to zoom in to see it)</strong></caption>
    <p>In Roblox, you can play different games that people make and you can create your own games in <strong>Roblox Studios</strong>. You can also create your own character with
      Roblox' currency, <strong>Robux</strong>. Be careful though, because there a lot of scam games that say "free Robux" and you can never get free robux. You always have to 
      buy it with real money.

    <h4> <u>Rocket League</u> </h4>

    <caption><strong>This is Rocket League and it does look like soccer but with cars I was not joking</strong></caption>
    <p>In Rocket Leauge, you can play some games but, this is a soccer game, but not an ordinary soccer game, it is a soccer game with cars. This game is pretty hard if you are on pc,
      but console is way easier. You can also get cosmetics for your wheels, on the top of your care, and more.</p>
